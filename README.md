# 500 days of code
## Preface
This is my journey to find peace and happiness through learning how to code. Inspired by movie 500 days of summer, directed by  [Marc Webb]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Webb").

Note that there had been awesome initiative like #100daysofcode on [Twitter]("https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode"). But after the incident of COVID-19, which very much affect my internship offer at Indeed.com for Software Development Role. I had a chance to reflect back and learned the hard way that I had not always been truly appreciate the beauty of coding and software development in general.

That said, I do not plan, nor force myself to follow this strictly but attempt to mark this as timeline on my journey of finding the joy in coding, and also improve my writing as an non-native English speaker through learning and writing.
